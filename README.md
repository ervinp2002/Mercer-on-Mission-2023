# Mercer on Mission 2023 - Data Science Workshop
This repo contains all components of the Data Science Workshop for the 2023 Mercoder Camp.

## Prerequisites
Ideally, this lesson is targeted for high school learners. At this point, they would have worked with Python and have been
exposed to basic syntax, operators, if-statements, for-loops, and while-loops. This lesson is meant to be a guided workshop, not one where learners must work on prompts independently. 

## Using the Program
The Python program is meant for whoever is teaching to walk through all aspects of the code with the rest of the class. This
lesson should be used on Replit so all learners can access the program and have their own copy to play around with. If 
you plan on using this on Replit, I recommend creating the Replit with the Python Data Science template, as it will have 
the *Pandas* and *PyPlot* libraries built in.

## Included Files
Other than the Python source code, the following files are also included: 

### instructions.md
This file will be the file that students can see when they first open up the program on Replit. This will act as a handout for the
class.

### lessonplan.md
This file will only be seen by the instructor. At the time of this writing (07/13/2023), it only contains code to answer the guided questions
that are included in the ***instructions.md*** file.

### loadsheddingData.csv / loadsheddingData.xlsx
This file contains the raw data that the Python program will use. The included Python program uses the CSV file, so any modifications
to the dataset, whether that be to cover more years, must be done to the CSV file. However, if you plan on adding more data, the program
must be modified to account for additional years to check for.

### Load_Shedding_All_Areas_Schedule_and_Map.pdf
This PDF file is a map showing off the load-shedding regions and what area numbers each region is linked to. This is good to show off at the 
start of the lesson.
